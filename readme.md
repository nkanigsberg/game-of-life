Rules:
For a space that is populated:
    - Each cell with one or no neighbours dies, as if by solitude.
    - Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    - Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.
For a space that is empty or unpopulated
    - Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated.
    - Each cell with six neighbours becomes populated.
